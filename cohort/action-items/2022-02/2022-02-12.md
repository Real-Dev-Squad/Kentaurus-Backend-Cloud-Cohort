Create a distributed database solution:

Spin up 6 EC2 instances, with IDs [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Nodes 1-5 are not connected to public internet, and only connect to the Node 0.
- Nodes 1-5 can be connected with each other.
- Nodes 1-5 can store at max 25 words each.
- Node 0 can store no words, or any transformational representation of the word (anything which can derive a word, without needing other nodes). It can store any other logic/metadata.
- Node 0 is connected to other nodes and to public internet, and exposes the following 

## APIs:

```
GET /words
```
Gets all the words in the database

```
DELETE /words
```
Deletes all words in the database

```
PATCH /node/{nodeId}?action=enable
```
Enables a node. It can now respond to requests.
nodeId is a number ranging from 0 - 4, denoting one of the 5 instances.

```
PATCH /node/{nodeId}?action=disable
```
Disables a node. It will not respond to requests until enabled.
nodeId is a number ranging from 0 - 4, denoting one of the 5 instances.

```
POST /words
{
	words: string[]
}
```
Adds the words in the DB
Upto 1000 words in the array, each of max size 20 characters.

```
GET /nodes/status?type=active
```
Returns an array of nodeIds of active nodes.
e.g [0, 2, 4] (if nodes 1, 3 are disabled)
