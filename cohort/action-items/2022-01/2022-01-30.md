What is EC2? - [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsRBftzZsQo)

Run a simple EC2 instance that helps you host two APIs:

- POST /word  { value: <string> }
- GET /word

The instnace should only remember the last word that was added to it using POST (Maybe the API should be a PUT in that case?).

Calling GET word, should return that last word that you POSTed.
